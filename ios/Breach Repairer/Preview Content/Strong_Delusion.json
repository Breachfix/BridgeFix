      "description": "The bold portion is missing in the modern versions. This omission changes the very definition of anti-Christ from denying that Jesus is come in the flesh to denying the existence of Jesus. Therefore a power acknowledging Jesus would escape detection as the anti-Christ, even while denying that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. Is this an unintentional blunder that crept into all these versions, or is this a predictable pattern with recognizable fingerprints?\n\nKlein, Martin.
