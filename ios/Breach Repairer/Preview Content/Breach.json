      "BookName":"ITANGURIRO",
      "Kjv":"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman,and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.",
      "Niv":"“I will put enmyties between thee & the woman,thy seed and the seed of her: she  shall bruise thy head in pieces, and thou shalt lie in wait of her heele.”",
      "Error":"Some of the commentators doubt whether these words refer to Mary or to Jesus Christ, because in the Septuagint version we read: ‘He shall crush thy head.’ But in our Vulgate, which is the only version approved by the Council of Trent, it is She, and not He. And thus St. Ambrose, St. Jerome, St. Augustine, St. John Chrysostom, and many others have understood it. However this may be, it is certain that the Son by means of the mother, or the mother by means of the Son,\n\n has vanquished Lucifer; so that this proud spirit, as St. Bernard tells us, has been ignominiously overpowered and crushed by this blessed Virgin. Hence as a slave conquered in war, he is forced always to obey the commands of this queen.”
      "Danger":"St. Cyprian affirms that the mother of our Lord Jesus Christ was promised in that woman: and hence he remarks, that God did not use the words I put, but I will put, lest the prophecy should seem to appertain to Eve. He said, I will put enmity between thee and the woman, to signify that this his vanquisher was not the living Eve, but must be another woman descending from her, who was to bring to our first parents greater blessings, as St. Vincent Ferrer says, than those they had lost by their sin. Mary, then, is this great and strong woman who has conquered the devil, and has crushed his head by subduing his pride, as the Lord added: ‘She shall crush thy head.’ and The Douay bible also provides theological changes to support the papal doctrine of transubstantiation.  ",
      "Evidence":"To demonstrate that this is indeed the meaning intended by this alteration we shall quote one of many Catholic sources that could be cited: “Not only most holy Mary is queen of heaven and of the saints, but also of hell and the devils, for she has bravely triumphed over them by her virtues. From the beginning of the world God predicted to the infernal serpent the victory and the empire which our queen would obtain over him, when he announced to him that a woman would come into the world who should conquer him. ‘I will put enmities between thee and the woman; she shall crush thy head.’ And what woman was this enemy if not Mary, who, with her beautiful humility and holy life, always conquered him and destroyed his forces? ",
      "Explanation":"The change in Genesis 3:15 provides the Roman church with an argument for the veneration of Mary, replacing Jesus with “the Virgin” in the Bible’s first Messianic prophecy.",

      "Error":"A BLOW AGAINST THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY",
      "Danger":"What need is there of a resurrection of the body, if, without our flesh, we can see\nGod? The tendency to make the resurrection from the tomb only a spiritual event is as\ngreat to-day as in the first Christian centuries.",
      "Evidence":"When he resurrects me, he is going to breathe back that breath of life into my decayed body. He will remember exactly everything about me. He recreates my body. When I see God, I see him in my flesh. All those resurrected in Scripture (including Jesus) were resurrected in their bodies. When the disciples thought their resurrected Lord was a ghost, Jesus said, “Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?  “Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.”[562]\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (p. 188). Savannah Pictures. Kindle Edition. ",
      "Explanation":"But, this Biblical doctrine does not fit well with the theory that when you die you go straight to heaven, and so the ASV[563] changed this verse to read, “And after my skin, even this body, is destroyed, Then without my flesh shall I see God;”[564] In other words, upon death, he shows up in heaven as a spirit? These two versions are completely opposite in meaning and in doctrine. Simple rules of logic demand that both of these statements cannot be true. Therefore one must be a lie—making it a doctrine of devils.\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (pp. 188-189). Savannah Pictures. Kindle Edition. ",

      "Evidence":"“Satan has long been preparing for his final effort to deceive the world. The foundation of his work was laid by the assurance given to Eve in Eden: ‘Ye shall not surely die... In the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.’ Genesis 3:4, 5. Little by little he has prepared the way for his masterpiece of deception in the development of spiritualism. He has not yet reached the full accomplishment of his designs; but it will be reached in the last remnant of time.”[570] Philip Schaff, member of the 1881 Revised Version committee and President of the translation committee for the American Standard Version reveals the purpose of these modifications: “The changes made thus far and communicated by you in confidence are judicious and in the right direction… and should contain the germs of the new theology…. “Every age must produce its own theology....\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (p. 190). Savannah Pictures. Kindle Edition. ",
      "Explanation":"“Such a theology will give new life to the church, and prepare the way for the reunion of Christendom.”[571] Clearly the changes are intentional, theological in nature, and for the purpose of reuniting Christendom. Preparing “the way for the reunion of Christendom,” is a veiled way of stating the intention to bring all churches into subjection to Rome. “God's word has given warning of the impending danger; let this be unheeded, and the Protestant world will learn what the purposes of Rome really are, only when it is too late to escape the snare. She is silently growing into power. Her doctrines are exerting their influence in legislative halls, in the churches, and in the hearts of men. She is piling up her lofty and massive structures in the secret recesses of which her former persecutions will be repeated. Stealthily and unsuspectedly she is strengthening her forces to further her own ends when the time shall come for her to strike. All that she desires is vantage ground, and this is already being given her. We shall soon see and shall feel what the purpose of the Roman element is. Whoever shall believe and obey the word of God will thereby incur reproach and persecution.”[572]\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (pp. 190-191). Savannah Pictures.

NIV Psalm 146:4 “When their spirit departs, they return to the ground; on that very day their plans come to nothing.”[565] The NIV changes “His breath goeth forth” to “their spirit departs.” Clearly the King James Bible is in harmony with the rest of Scripture that the dead know not anything.

But, the Good News Bible says, “Enjoy life with the one you love...” Here marriage is not essential, nor is it essential that it be a woman. Just live with whoever you love “as long as you live this useless life that God has given you in this world. Enjoy every useless day of it, because it is all you will get for all your trouble.”[535] Is our life useless?

Yet, several modern versions remove the virgin birth. Notice how the Good News Bible[468] puts it: “Well then, the Lord himself will give you a sign. A young woman who is pregnant will have a son and will name him Immanuel.”[469] How is a young woman being pregnant a sign? We must have millions of signs every day.\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (p. 158). Savannah Pictures. Kindle Edition. ",
      "Evidence":"The Jewish religion does not accept the New Testament, or believe that Jesus was the Messiah. They certainly do not accept that Jesus was divine. Therefore, a clear prediction in their Old Testament Scriptures for the virgin birth, fulfilled in the New Testament, is a problem for them, knowing that Christians appeal to this verse as evidence of the divinity and Messiahship of Jesus. As one might expect, the Jewish Publication Society does not like the verse, and also changed “virgin” to “young woman.”\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (p. 158). Savannah Pictures. Kindle Edition. ",
      "Explanation":"The Revised Standard Version does the same thing. As it turns out there was a Jewish scholar on the Revised Standard Version translation committee named H.M. Orlinsky, of the Jewish Institute of Religion in New York. It is quite probable that he lent his influence to the removal of the virgin birth in this version. Rabbi Balfour Brickner of the Temple Sinai in Washington, regarding this verse, declares, “I am delighted to know that at last this great error of translation has been finally corrected, and that at least some elements of the Christian world no longer maintain that Isaiah 7:14 is a prediction that Jesus would be born of the Virgin Mary.”[470] Clearly he sees this change as denying the virgin birth.\n\nKlein, Martin.

Even if one assumed that “the Anointed One” referred to Jesus, the next phrase says that he will be cut off and have nothing.

      "Kjv":"But I say unto you,\nLove your enemies,\nbless them that curse\nyou, do good to them\nthat hate you, and pray\nfor them which\ndespitefully use you,\nand persecute you",
      "Niv":"But I tell you: Love\nyour enemies and\npray for those who\npersecute you.",
      "Error":"",
      "Danger":"The phrase “bless them that curse you” is omitted from both the Revised and the\nJesuit. On this Canon Cook says, “Yet this enormous omission rests on the sole authority\nof # and B.” f135 (That is, on the Vatican Manuscript and the one found in 1859 in a\nCatholic monastery.) Thus we see that the Revised Version is not a revision in any sense\nwhatever, but a new Bible based on different manuscripts from the King James, on\nCatholic manuscripts in fact.",
      "Evidence":"",
      "Explanation":"'Here we notice a most subtle accommodation of Catholic thought. The\nmissing phrases are “Bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate\nyou.” Who could be offended by these Christ-given directions, given in the\nSermon on the Mount?\nBut if we think carefully, we see that Rome is in the business of cursing\nand hating heretics, those faithful Christians who believe the Word of God\nand accept it as their spiritual guide rather than the faulted doctrines of\nmen. The word Rome uses is anathema. It is applied liberally throughout\nthe findings of councils. And of course they do not want their people to\nsee Christlikeness in those whom they curse.Roman Catholicism has ever taught that man may die in his sins and yet\nultimately reach the state of bliss. The whole doctrine of purgatory\nsupports this concept. The act of performing requiems for the dead is\nsupposed to facilitate this transition. Many Protestants have accepted\nvarious modifications of this view, some asserting that God will eventually\nsave all through a worldwide conversion during the millennium.'",

      "Error":"Babbling like pagans, and vain repetitions are most certainly not the same thing. It would be good, perhaps, not to babble like pagans, but who will be convicted of their vain repetitions by this modified verse? A Catholic would say ‘I don’t babble like the pagans.’ This interpretation removes from Scripture a very strong condemnation of the Catholic method of praying, thereby supporting papal doctrine.\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (p. 68). Savannah Pictures. Kindle Edition. ",
      "Danger":"“A prayerful study of the Bible would show Protestants the real character of the papacy and would cause them to abhor and to shun it; but many are so wise in their own conceit that they feel no need of humbly seeking God that they may be led into the truth. Although priding themselves on their enlightenment, they are ignorant both of the Scriptures and of the power of God. They must have some means of quieting their consciences, and they seek that which is least spiritual and humiliating. What they desire is a method of forgetting God which shall pass as a method of remembering Him. The papacy is well adapted to meet the wants of all these. It is prepared for two classes of mankind, embracing nearly the whole world—those who would be saved by their merits, and those who would be saved in their sins. Here is the secret of its power.”[202]\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (pp. 68-69). Savannah Pictures. Kindle Edition. ",
      "Evidence":"It should come as no surprise that there are Catholic leanings in modern bibles, since most of the recent ones openly included Catholic scholars on their translation committees, and the NASB kept secret the names of those serving on the translation committee. Even in the early versions such as the Revised Version, where Roman influence was being hidden, the Catholic leanings of lead translators Brooke Foss Westcott and Fenton John Anthony Hort are easily demonstrable.\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (p. 69). Savannah Pictures. Kindle Edition. ",
      "Explanation":"Hort states, “I have been persuaded for many years that Mary-worship and Jesus-worship have very much in common in their causes and their results.”[203] And, “the pure Romish view seems to me nearer, and more likely to lead to, the truth than the Evangelical.”[204] Regarding the death of Westcott, the following was written by the Sunderland Free Church Council, “We recognise [sic], with deep gratitude to the great Head of the Church, the many Christian qualities and eminent graces which were patent to the most casual observer of the life of Bishop Westcott. His love to Christ, his genuine piety, his reverent manner, his catholic spirit, his spiritual instinct, his social interest, his practical help, his ripe scholarship, and his humble bearing, are a few of the traits which were manifest in him, and which call for our praise to God.”[205] The papacy considers freedom of conscience to be heretical. Thus the freedom of religion that is fundamental to American liberty is simply tolerated until a change can be affected without danger to Catholicism.[206] Hort hated America and the freedoms it stood for. Speaking of the Civil War he said: “While the war lasts, therefore, I fully sympathize with the South.... I care more for England and for Europe than for America, how much more than for all the niggers in the world! and I contend that the highest morality requires me to do so.... it cannot be wrong to desire and pray from the bottom of one’s heart that the American Union may be shivered to pieces.”[207] Is this the fine Christian gentleman that you would choose to translate your bible for you?[208] Papal doctrine teaches salvation by works, or by your own merits, rather than the merits of Jesus. Modern versions insert this doctrine in a most blatant way.\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (pp. 69-70). Savannah Pictures. Kindle Edition. ",

      "Danger":"“‘I have here given every passage without exception in which the word\n‘converted’ in the passive voice occurs in the older translation. In every one of these\ninstances the passive form is avoided in the new translation. The change seems to be one\nof incalculable importance. The former version teaches men that they are converted by a\npower external to themselves; the later version teaches them to turn themselves. In other\nwords, the doctrine of superhuman conversion disappears from the New Testament, and\nthus the main foundation of modern Evangelicalism is destroyed. Only a few Sundays\nago it was my misfortune to have to listen to a long “Evangelical” sermon, the whole\nburden of which was that men could not convert themselves. This pernicious tenet is\npreached every year in myriads of sermons, books, and tracts. I rejoice that it is now\nshown to be unscriptural.’” f367\nAlso Dr. Milligan, commenting on this change in <401803> Matthew 18:3 and in\nActs 3:19, says that “the opening verb, though passive in form, is properly rendered\nactively, and the popular error of men being mere passive instruments in the hands of\nGod are thereby exploded.” f368\n<440319>\nThe dangerous doctrine of salvation by our own effort is exalted; and the miracle-\nsaving power of God in conversion, so far as these texts are concerned, is thrust out of the\nNew Testament. The Revised changes the doctrine of conversion, and that change is a\ncomplete reversal of the doctrine.",

The word ‘presence’ for ‘coming’ and ‘the consummation of the age’ now standing for ‘the end of the world,’ have altered, of late, the whole meaning, even for the most sincere Christian, if we exempt the Adventists.... “Two things become evident to all in the above passages, now that their false rendering is corrected in the revision text: (a) ‘the coming of Christ,’ means the presence of CHRISTOS in a regenerated world, and not at all the actual coming in body of ‘Christ’ Jesus; (b) this Christ is to be sought neither in the wilderness nor ‘in the inner chambers,’ nor in the sanctuary of any temple or church built by man; for Christ—the true esoteric SAVIOR—is no man, but the DIVINE PRINCIPLE in every human being.... “Millenarians and Adventists of robust faith may go on saying that ‘the coming of (the carnalized) Christ’ is near at hand, and prepare themselves for ‘the end of the world.’ Theosophists—at any rate, some of them—who understand the hidden meaning of the universally expected Avatars, Messiahs, Sosioshes, and Christs— know that it is no ‘end of the world,’ but ‘the consummation of the age,’ i.e., the close of a cycle, which is now fast approaching.”[479]\n\nKlein, Martin.

      "Evidence":"Blavatsky, once again, believes that the KJV version is full of errors and that these errors were corrected in the Revised Version, from which she claims that the coming of Jesus is not a literal coming of the physical Jesus Christ, but the inner discovery of one’s own godhood. This should seriously concern any person who believes the Bible, or has reservations about Occultism. Scripture says, “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?”[480]\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (p. 162).

Since the introduction of the so-\ncalled revised versions, \"Repentance\" is a subject that is seldom heard. And since the rising flood of these\nperversions into our church \"Repentance\" is practically never heard. Is this an underlying cause of\ndeepening lukewarmness? In love Jesus says to Laodicea - to each one of us, \"Be zealous therefore, and\nrepent.\" Steps to Christ, has \"Repentance as the first step to justification and acceptance.

The King James says that it is hard for them that trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God, but the NIV says “how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!” The lawyers in the Bible were the equivalent of today’s theologians. The law of God was the foundation of the legal system of the Jewish nation. Therefore when one studied law, he studied the Bible—God’s law. Jesus warned them: Luke 11:52 “Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.”\n\nKlein, Martin.

One of the saddest changes in relationship to repentance and salvation is where the Bible’s ability to heal the brokenhearted has been removed. There are many brokenhearted people in this world. They want to go to the Bible to know that God understands them, to know that Jesus can heal their broken hearts and heal the wounds and pain they feel.\n\nKlein, Martin.

We are\nreminded again of our Lord’s statement in:-\nLUKE 4:4 \"And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by\nevery word of God.\"\nHowever the N.I.V. omits the key words of this text underlined. \"But by every word of God.\"",
      "Explanation":"Sister White has beautifully stated in \"The Ministry of Healing\" p. 48.\n\"After the multitude had been fed, there was an abundance of food left. Jesus bade His disciples, ‘Gather up\nthe fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.’ These words meant more than putting the food into baskets.\nThe lesson was twofold. Nothing is to be wasted. We are to let slip no temporal advantage. We should\nneglect nothing that would serve to benefit a human being. Let everything be gathered up that will relieve\nthe necessities of earth’s hungry ones. With the same carefulness are we to treasure the bread from heaven\nto satisfy the needs of the soul. By every word of God we are to live. Nothing that God has spoken is to be\nlost. Not one word that concerns our eternal salvation are we to neglect. Not one word is to fall useless to\nthe ground.\" Again in \"Desire of Ages,\" page 123:-\n\"Every promise in God’s word is ours. By ‘every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God’ are we to\nlive.\"\nIt is apparent from this and the many, many examples we have given that it looks impossible to accept the\nSpirit of Prophecy and the N.I.V. or any of the many corrupted modern versions. They both cannot be true.",

The same modification is performed on Luke 2:43. “Helvidius, the devoted scholar of Northern Italy (A.D. 400) who had the pure MSS, accused Jerome [the author of the Catholic Latin Vulgate] of using corrupt manuscripts on this very text.... Jerome did exactly what the American Revised and Jesuit Bibles did, that is, they gave Jesus a human father.”[457]\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (p. 155).

Burnside.\n\"The Bible, which is to judge us in the last day.\" Early Writings, page 58.\nAs judgment-bound mortals we do well to head God’s guidebook. The enemy would confuse. The oft\nrepeated claim that the N.I.V is simpler and clearer is exposed in the light of facts. For instance note:-\nISAIAH 8.20 \"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there\nis no light in them.\nNow notice the N.I.V. \"To the law and to the testimony. If they do not speak according to this word, they\nhave no light of dawn. Distressed and hungry, they will roam through the land.\"\nIs this clearer? The aim of these modern translators is not clarity. It is to change the Word of God by\nomission and then by corruption. The most significant changes in the N.I.V. and other modern versions are\nnot changes in translation but changes in the Greek text that are used. They are based on corrupted\nmanuscripts. The revisers reject the Majority Text and rely mainly on two corrupt texts of Rome.",

They enumerate all the other things, but leave out the healing of the broken heart.[512] Some might say that another verse in the Bible says he can heal the broken heart. It is true. In the Old Testament, in the book of Isaiah,[513] the modern versions do not remove the healing of the brokenhearted. Should not that be good enough? If someone is brokenhearted, and they are going to the Bible for hope and healing in the midst of heartbreak, are they more likely to go to the Old Testament or the New Testament? Are they more likely to read Isaiah or Luke? What if the only verse that they go to is missing the very comfort they need? Is this not an important truth that has been left out of God’s Word? We must live by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God, even (and especially) if he repeats himself.\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (p. 170).

So the Revisers have exposed believers in the Bible to the ridicule of\nunbelievers because they describe the supernatural events of the New Testament by\nbelittling words. To describe the supernatural in terms of the natural, indicates doubt in\nthe supernatural. If we persist in calling a mountain a molehill, it is evident that we do not\nbelieve it is a mountain. The Revisers, in persistently describing supernatural events by\nordinary terms, have changed doctrines respecting miracles. And if they made such\nfundamental changes in these thirty-two New Testament texts, — all there was on the\nsubject, — what is this, but systematic depravation of doctrine?",

      "Evidence":"JOHN 14:6 \"Jesus said unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes unto the Father, but\nby me.\"\nIt is because of these deceptive omissions and changes that I will never use the N.I.V. as the infallible\nScriptures.\nWe have an infallible Bible, and our truth is based on \"many infallible proofs.\"",
      "Explanation":"--(ON ME) is out. He that believes--What is the key to salvation? How do we attain salvation? On whom do we believe to gain everlasting life? Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the one name given among men, under heaven, whereby we must be saved. But, the NIV[502] changes this to: “I tell you the truth. He who believes has everlasting life.”[503] Believes what? Removed is the one “name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” If you want to have an ecumenical religion, for a One World Order, that pleases everyone, you cannot have one religion claiming that Jesus is the only way. That is not acceptable to Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, and many others. Jesus must be reduced, on par with all the other religious leaders, which means his divinity must be denied, and his claim to be the only way to salvation must be removed. Modern versions are the ecumenical tools to unite all religions. Eugene Nida, considered one of greatest modern linguists and Executive Secretary for Translations for the American Bible Society, recounts the following experience: “After completing a series of lectures at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome, I chatted with a young Jesuit who expressed his appreciation for what I had said about putting the Scriptures into the every-day language of the people. He insisted that this was the most important development since the Reformation.”[505] The goal of Rome has ever been world domination and control of all religions. Ever since the reformation they have bent every effort to reestablish their lost supremacy. If modern bibles are the most important development since the reformation, then they are the most important tool to overthrow everything the reformation has done. Speaking to the Parliament of World Religions, Philipp Schaff said, “There is a unity of Christian scholarship of all creeds… This unity has been strikingly illustrated in the Anglo-American Revision of the Authorized Version of the Scriptures.”[506] Schaff credits the unity of all creeds at the parliament to the American Standard Version and Revised Version of the Bible.\n\nKlein, Martin.

Indeed many modern evangelists seem to think that drama or movies, sports or coffee parlors, music or dancing—anything but preaching—is the way to take the gospel to the world.\n\nKlein, Martin.

Does this make any sense? The Moffatt Bible goes so far as to call it “the ‘sheer folly’ of the Christian message.”[\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (p. 174).

      "Danger":"The word “Lord” is omitted in the Jesuit and Revised Versions. The Authorized\ntells specifically who is that Man from heaven.",
      "Evidence":"Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, introduced earlier, demonstrates this point further.[440] Blavatsky uses this verse, as it is in modern versions, to try to prove the immortality of the soul.[441] She asserts that Paul “maintains that there is a psychical body which is sown in the corruptible, and a spiritual body that is raised in incorruptible substance. ‘The first man is of the earth earthy, the second man from heaven.’”[442] This perspective is highly revealing, because when you realize that the mother of modern occultism is saying the same thing as many modern Christians, then you begin to discern that there is not much distance between modern occultism and modern Christianity. This should not be surprising since God said that at the end of time nearly the whole world would worship Satan.[443] Blavatsky is not applying the second man to Jesus Christ in any way. She is saying that the second man is a spiritual body that goes to heaven when the individual dies. It suits the theological purposes of the mother of modern occultism for the phrase, “the Lord” to be left out of the verse. Should not Christians question aligning themselves with the mother of modern spiritualism, by choosing a modern version that contains this change? In 1 Timothy 4:1-2, the Bible says, “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;  “Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron.” What Blavatsky is asserting is a doctrine of devils. People are departing from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. The issue at stake is whether we will accept the doctrines of Jesus Christ, or the doctrines of devils. There are only two choices.\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (pp. 149-150). Savannah Pictures. Kindle Edition. ",
      "Explanation":"This is an obvious reference to the first man, or Adam, being made of the dust of the ground. The second man, Jesus Christ, is the Lord from heaven. Jesus was the second Adam.[438] Many of the modern translations, including the NIV, NASB, ASV, CEV, DRB, ESV, GNB, ICB, RV, and the New World Translation (the Jehovah’s Witness Bible—which has a vested interest in removing the divinity of Christ) leave out the phrase, “the Lord.” So they say, “The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven.”[439] The wording might be slightly different in each version, but they consistently leave out “the Lord.” To some, this might not seem like a serious issue, since most Christians already believe that Jesus is divine. However, in order for Satan to command worship from the whole world, he must first convince them that Jesus is not divine.\n\nKlein, Martin.

In Ephesians 3:14 “of our Lord Jesus Christ,” being left out, removes the connection that God the Father is the father of our Lord Jesus Christ. This alone does not prove a systematic attempt to remove the divinity of Jesus, but, these changes certainly make it easier to assert that he is not divine. If this just happened in one or two places, some might assert that nothing had materially changed in the doctrines of the Bible. But, once you see the pattern, and the vast amount of evidence pointing in this direction, you realize that these changes reduce the power and majesty of Jesus Christ.\n\nKlein, Martin.

      "Danger":"What a piece of revision this is! The teaching of the divinity of our Lord Jesus\nChrist upheld by the King James Bible in this text is destroyed in both the other versions.\nThe King James says, “God” was manifest in the flesh; the Revised says, “He who.” “He\nwho” might have been an angel or even a good man like Elijah. It would not have been a\ngreat mystery for a man to be manifest in the flesh.",
      "Evidence":"The Revisers made this change which confounds Christ with the movement He\ninstituted, the gospel, and leads our minds away from Christ, the person on His heavenly\nthrone, to Christ, the bread of the Lord’s supper, (Mass), on the ritualistic altar-throne.\nWhat is this, if not a change of doctrine? Bishop Westcott was conscious of the change\nthe Revisers were making in this reading. On this the Princeton Review says:\n“Making Christianity a life — the divine-human life of Christ — has far-reaching\nconsequences. It confounds and contradicts the Scriptural and church doctrine as to the\nPerson of Christ.”",
      "Explanation":"“The reader may easily miss the real character of this deeply instructive change.\nThe passage now becomes a description of the essential character of the gospel, and not\nsimply a series of historical statements. The gospel is personal. The gospel — ’the\nrevelation of godliness’ — is, in a word, Christ Himself, and not any propositions about\nChrist.”",

      "Error":"The Amplified Bible says, “By faith we understand that the worlds [during the successive ages][538] were framed—fashioned, put in order, and equipped for their intended purpose—by the word of God, so that what we see was not made out of things which are visible.”[539] Now, God is not a creator, he just took what was there and put it in order, and equipped it for its intended purpose. “During the successive ages” is clearly intended to make room for the evolutionary theory. To demonstrate conclusively that this is what the translators had in mind, let us quote Westcott regarding this verse: “In this connection we can see the full meaning of the words used of creation in Heb. xi. 3: By faith we understand that the worlds (the ages, i.e. the universe under the aspect of time) have been formed by the Word of God…. The whole sequence of life in time, which we call ‘the world,’ has been ‘fitted together’ by God. His one creative word included the harmonious unfolding on one plan of the last issues of all that was made. That which is in relation to Him ‘one act at once’ is in relation to us an evolution apprehended in orderly succession.”[540] This idea was incorporated into the margin of Westcott and Hort’s Revised Version.[541] Westcott boldly states that this change means that creation in relation to God seemed like an instant, but in relation to us, it was “an evolution apprehended in orderly succession.” That he intended for this change to make provision for evolution is unambiguous. He tells us his sentiments on the subject explicitly: “No one now, I suppose, holds that the first three chapters of Genesis, for example, give a literal history—I could never understand how any one reading them with open eyes could think they did.”[542] Hort is of the same opinion: “But the book which has most engaged me is Darwin. Whatever may be thought of it, it is a book that one is proud to be contemporary with. I must work out and examine the argument more in detail, but at present my feeling is strong that the theory is unanswerable. If so, it opens up a new period.”[543] This also demonstrates that changes inserted into the margin in early versions[544] are destined to appear within the text in later versions. Additionally, these changes are manifestly intentional, with theological implications.\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (pp. 176-178). Savannah Pictures. Kindle Edition. ",
      "Danger":"But the LITV says, “By faith we understand the ages to have been framed by the Word of God, so that the things seen should not come into being out of the things that appear.”[536] This is actually an injection of the theory of evolution into Holy Writ.[537] According to this version, God’s Word only framed the ages, and then the ages took care of themselves—according to the theory—allowing for evolution. If God’s Word framed the worlds, then it happened just as Genesis records—God spoke and it was so. However, having God’s Word frame the ages gives the wiggle room to introduce theistic evolution. To have an ecumenical world where all religions become one, even the religion of evolution must be accommodated, so bibles must be created to provide room for all beliefs—doctrinal pluralism. Some may say that too much is being read into this change. Let us see if other versions take this idea even further, and then investigate whether the translators actually intended such a meaning.\n\nKlein, Martin.

      "Evidence":"In Hebrews 11:3, the Bible says, “Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.” The worlds were framed by the word of God. These are profound divine Words that tell us of his creative power and ability.\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (pp. 175-176). Savannah Pictures. Kindle Edition.

      "Evidence":"“The strongest evidence [for the authenticity of the Johannine Comma], however, is found in the Greek text itself. Looking at 1 John 5:8, there are three nouns which, in Greek, stand in the neuter (Spirit, water, and blood). However, they are followed by a participle that is masculine. The Greek phrase here is oi marturountes (who bare witness). Those who know the Greek language understand this to be poor grammar if left to stand on its own. Even more noticeable, verse six has the same participle but stands in the neuter (Gk.: to marturoun). Why are three neuter nouns supported with a masculine participle? The answer is found if we include verse seven. There we have two masculine nouns (Father and Son) follow by a neuter noun (Spirit). The verse also has the Greek masculine participle oi marturountes. With this clause introducing verse eight, it is very proper for the participle in verse eight to be masculine because of the masculine nouns in verse seven. But if verse seven were not there it would become improper Greek grammar.”[449] This was recognized by scholars as early as Gregory of Nazianzus (A.D. 390). The Catholic Dublin Review makes the following scathing indictment against this excision, “On the 17th of May the English-speaking world awoke to find that its Revised Bible had banished the Heavenly Witnesses and put the devil in the Lord’s Prayer. Protests loud and deep went forth against the insertion, against the omission none. It is well, then, that the Heavenly Witnesses should depart whence their testimony is no longer received. The Jews have a legend that shortly before the destruction of their Temple, the Shechinah departed from the Holy of Holies, and the Sacred Voices were heard saying, ‘Let us go hence.’ So perhaps it is to be with the English Bible, the Temple of Protestantism. The going forth of the Heavenly Witnesses is the sign of the beginning of the end.”[450] “God never asks us to believe, without giving sufficient evidence upon which to base our faith. His existence, His character, the truthfulness of His word, are all established by testimony that appeals to our reason; and this testimony is abundant. Yet God has never removed the possibility of doubt. Our faith must rest upon evidence, not demonstration. Those who wish to doubt will have opportunity; while those who really desire to know the truth will find plenty of evidence on which to rest their faith.”[451] Not only do modern versions tamper with the divinity of Christ, but they tamper with his humanity. The Bible teaches that Jesus, having the perfect divine nature of God, took on our sinful human nature[452] and became both human and divine—though he did not sin.\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (pp. 152-154). Savannah Pictures. Kindle Edition. ",
      "Explanation":"Although it varies from version to version, more or less of the bold portion is removed from most modern versions. The scholars refer to this statement as the Johannine Comma, with critical scholarship claiming that the verse was not added until the late fourth-century/early fifth-century trinitarian controversies. “Unfortunately for the critics, these claims are either outright falsehoods, or else rest upon incomplete information. Worse, they continue to be propagated uncritically by naturalistic textual scholars like Bruce Metzger and Kurt and Barbara Aland, whose written works routinely perpetuate false information based upon a partial coverage of the evidence available.”[447] While it is true that the Comma is not found in the majority of the Greek manuscripts, it is found in a couple of the early lectionaries, some of the earliest translations (such as the old Latin and the Syriac), and the ancient Waldensian manuscripts, who preserved the word of God “unadulterated.”[448] It is also quoted by numerous ancient sources, from Tertullian, Cyprian, and Priscillian, to Athanasius, Aurelius and Vigilius Tapensis, to name a few.\n\nKlein, Martin.

      "Error":"God laid down his life for us. Jesus is clearly being called God in this passage. Some might argue that the King James Version supplied the words “of God” and therefore the statement is not warranted. The context (going back to verse 9) demands that we are talking about God in verse 16. The NIV changes this to: “This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.”[458] This is not a false statement, because it is true that Jesus laid down his life for us. However, the statement has removed reference to the divinity of Jesus, no longer calling him God. The proponents of the modern versions stand indicted for the very thing they accuse the King James Version of, by adding the words “Jesus Christ.” Even the corrupted manuscripts do not contain these words. At least the KJV shows you which words are supplied, and supplies words faithful to the context. The NIV does not indicate that words have been supplied and by ignoring the context remove the infinite truth that it was the Sovereign God of the Universe who laid down his life for us.\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (pp. 155-156). Savannah Pictures. Kindle Edition. ",
      "Danger":"Further, he informs us that “forty-six times the KJV uses the term ‘master’ when for today’s reader it should use the term ‘teacher.’”[465] Now, why does today’s reader need to hear “teacher” instead of “master”? Does today’s reader not understand the word “master”? Is master an archaic word that has passed out of the English language? Master must be replaced with teacher in the New International Version because, in order to bring all religions together; the divinity of Jesus must be knocked down a little lower. Muslims, Unitarians, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Hindus, occultists, and many others, do not accept the divinity of Christ.\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (p. 157). Savannah Pictures. Kindle Edition. ",
      "Evidence":"Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, the mother of the new age and modern occultism, says exactly the same thing as these Bible translators: “there is not a word in the so-called sacred scriptures to show that Jesus was actually regarded as God by his disciples. Neither before nor after his death did they pay him divine honors.”[466] This statement, from a worshiper of Lucifer, is nothing but a doctrine of devils, for Scripture plainly states, “And Thomas answered and said unto him, my Lord and my God.”[467] When bible translators presume to insert into Scripture, the doctrines of devils that the mother of occultism is promoting, and admit it with their own mouths, who can possibly continue to deny that there is a problem?\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (pp. 157-158). Savannah Pictures. Kindle Edition. ",
      "Explanation":"Despite the abundant evidence for a concerted effort to undermine the divinity of Christ, some might still find it hard to believe that these alterations are intentional, with a specific motive. Therefore, let us turn to the testimony of the translators themselves. Perhaps some of their beliefs help to explain how these changes occurred. Vance Smith,[459] a member of the revision committee for the Revised Version of 1881 (the grandfather of all modern versions) claims the following, “It is well understood that the New Testament contains neither precept nor example which really sanctions the religious worship of Jesus Christ.”[460] Jesus told Satan, in the wilderness of temptation, “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.”[461] Therefore, by claiming that no precept or example in the New Testament sanctions the worship of Jesus, Smith is asserting that there is no evidence for the divinity of Christ.  Smith goes on to tell us, “The changes just enumerated are manifestly of great importance, and are they not wholly unfavorable to the popular theology? Many persons will deny this, but it is hard to see on what grounds they do so. Or, if it be true that the popular orthodoxy remains unaffected by such changes, the inference is unavoidable that popular orthodoxy must be very indifferent to the nature of the foundation on which it stands.”[462] Under the heading of “Doctrinal Changes,” Smith writes, “Since the publication of the revised New Testament, it has been frequently said that the changes of the translation which the work contains are of little importance from a doctrinal point of view;–in other words that the great doctrines of popular theology remain unaffected, untouched by the results of the revision.... To the writer any such statement appears to be in the most substantial sense contrary to the facts of the case.”[463] Here we have admission, from one of the translators, that the changes in the Revised Version are doctrinal in nature. In the face of such testimony, how can anyone argue that there are no changes affecting doctrine? Is there similar evidence from the translators of other versions? It so happens that the chief editor of the New International Version, Edwin Palmer, echoes similar sentiments, regarding the divinity of Christ, in declaring that there are “few clear and decisive texts that declare Jesus is God.”[464]\n\nKlein, Martin.

      "Explanation":"Notice the King James Bible says “God and his Father.” If you say “God and his Father,” that means God is one person and his father is another person. So the Father is the father of God. With this wording, the Bible is calling Jesus God, therefore Jesus is completely divine. But, in the modern versions, including the New World Translation (or Jehovah’s Witness Bible), it says, “his God and Father.” These are the very same words, in a slightly different order. “His God and Father” means, that Jesus has a god and Jesus has a father. But, it is not calling Jesus God. The divinity of Christ has been removed from this verse by a simple change in word order. You may have to sit and think about this for some time to understand the implications, but this is a profound change. Not only do modern bibles diminish the divinity of Christ, but they attack the three divine personalities of the Godhead. This they do, because the triune nature of the Godhead proves the divinity of Christ. The most notorious attack on God’s Word is in the removal, in most modern versions, of the most explicit statement of the triune Godhead in all of Scripture: 1 John 5:7, and part of verse eight.\n\nKlein, Martin.

      "Error":"Universalism is the theological name for the belief that everyone will be saved, no matter what they do. Some universalists actually go so far as to claim that the Devil will be saved. In the King James Version this verse implies that people are crying because they realize that they are wrong and are lost. They are wailing because of him. There is clearly no universalism there. Notice how modern bibles alter the words to support universalism. The Revised Version says, “Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they which pierced him; and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn over him. Even so, Amen.”[\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (p. 162). Savannah Pictures. Kindle Edition. ",
      "Danger":"Wailing because of him and mourning over him are two totally different things. With this change the verse is no longer a reference to the fact that some are wailing because of their lost condition, instead they seem to be mourning his death, rather than rejoicing at his coming. Some might claim that the original word can be translated mourn as well as wail. Perhaps. But, the context clearly does not support such a change. The statement does not even make sense. Westcott tells us the reason for inserting this change into the text. He says, “all the tribes of the earth shall mourn over him in penitential sorrow, not as the Authorized Version,[482] shall wail because of him in the present expectation of terrible vengeance.”[483]\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (pp. 162-163). Savannah Pictures. Kindle Edition. ",
      "Evidence":"Westcott understands very explicitly the theological implications of the two different renderings.[484] He understands the King James Version to mean that the kindreds of the earth are wailing because of Jesus, expecting terrible vengeance to come upon them because of their sins, since they have not repented. He says the change in his Revised Version shows that they mourn over him in penitential sorrow, implying that these people are giving penance, or coming to repentance at the second coming of Jesus, so that they can all be saved. Apparently, in Westcott’s theology, Jesus forgives them and takes everyone to heaven, instead of vengeance falling on a certain group of people. He informs us of the very important difference in theology between the two versions. Two very different doctrines—one the doctrine of Jesus Christ, the other the doctrine of devils.[485]\n\nKlein, Martin. Above All Thy Name: Thou Hast Magnified Thy Word (p. 163). Savannah Pictures.

      "Explanation":"This verse makes specific claims for the divinity of Jesus Christ. The twenty-four elders bow in worship to the Lord God Almighty. They are clearly worshipping the God of the universe “which art, and wast, and art to come.” This can be none other than Jesus Christ himself, as he is the one that promised to come again. Therefore the verse is presenting Jesus as the Lord God Almighty. This makes Jesus God. In order to avoid the conclusion that Jesus is the one specified in this text, modern bibles leave out the bold portion.[471] Perhaps the ExeGeses Companion Bible demonstrates how far things have degenerated: ECB Revelation 11:17 “wording, We eucharistize you, O Yah Veh El Sabaoth, who is and who was and who is coming; for you are taking your mega dynamis and reign:”[472] Does this make any sense? Is this easier to read? The claim is continually made that modern versions are needed, because the old language cannot be comprehended. Notice the Catholic wording, “we eucharistize you.” The Eucharist is the Catholic host or communion wafer, and is certainly not a Protestant word. Many Protestants lost their lives for their refusal to partake of the host. “All the outward pomp and display of the Romish worship was brought to bear to confuse the mind and dazzle and captivate the imagination, and thus the liberty for which the fathers had toiled and bled was betrayed by the sons.”[473]\n\nKlein, Martin.

By following papal doctrine in Revelation 19:8, the NKJV[212] is entangled in the irrationality of directly contradicting itself in Isaiah 64:6. Two contradictory statements cannot both be true, therefore one must be false, or a lie. Since the Bible says that God cannot lie,[213] these modern versions, covered with the fingerprints of the anti-Christ, cannot be the true word of God.\n\nKlein, Martin.

Here in Revelation 9:15 the Word of God is so changed to entirely\nalter the meaning and so do away with the Truth of this amazing prophecy that revealed the downfall of the\nEastern Roman Empire on the 11th August 1840. Sister White wrote thus on this wonderful fulfillment of\ndivine prophecy:-\n\"In the year 1840 another remarkable fulfillment of prophecy excited widespread interest. Two years\nbefore, Josiah Litch, one of the leading ministers preaching the second advent, published an exposition of\nRevelation 9, predicting the fall of the Ottoman Empire. According to his calculations, this power was to be\noverthrown ‘in AD. 1840, sometime in the-month of August;’ and only a few days previous to its\naccomplishment he wrote: ‘Allowing the first period, 150-years, to have been exactly fulfilled before\nDeacozes ascended the throne by permission’ Of the Turks, and that the 391 years, fifteen days,\ncommenced at the close of the first period, it will-end on the 11th of August, 1840, when the Ottoman.\npower in Constantinople may be expected to be broken. And this, I believe, will be found to be the case.\nJosiah Litch, in Signs of the Times, and Expositor of Prophecy, Aug.1, 1840.\nAt the very time specified, Turkey, through her ambassadors, accepted the protection of the allied powers\nof Europe, and thus placed herself under the control of Christian nations. The event exactly fulfilled the\nprediction. When it became known, multitudes were convinced of the correctness of the principles of\nprophetic interpretation adopted by Miller and his associates, and a wonderful impetus was given to the\nadvent movement. Men of learning and position united with Miller, both in preaching and in publishing his\nviews, and from 1840 to 1844 the work rapidly extended.\" Great Controversy, page 334,5.",
      "Evidence":"Notice-further It is often claimed that the N.I.V. is clearer and more simple. The absurdity of this claim is\nagain revealed by reading this text in the N.I.V.:-\nREVELATION 9:15 \"And the four angels who have been kept ready for this very hour and day and month\nand year were released to kill a third of mankind.\"\nSimple? Clear? The only simple and clear thing about the N.I.V. is that it is simply and clearly wrong. This\nis the only simple and clear thing about it.\nJesus our Lord gave us the test. May you heed the word of Christ.\nJOHN 14:29 \"And now I have told your before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, you might\nbelieve.\"\nProphecy is to present the evidence that will lead us to \"believe.\" The \"infallible\" evidence of fulfilled\nprophecy is to appeal to our logic. To lead us to give up our doubts and believe.\nREV-1:1 \"The Revelation of Jesus Christ which... was to shew unto His servants things which must shortly\ncome to pass,\" accomplished the plan and purpose of our Lord in 1840., with the conversion \"of over a\nthousand unbelievers by the fulfillment of just one small-part of this incredible prophecy. This prophecy\ngiven by Christ, accomplished its Christ given purpose. This the enemy hates, so through. his agents he has\nthe N.I.V. changed to deceive and the lukewarm sleepy multitudes are too indolent to bother whether it is\ntruth or falsehood.\nToday confusion reigns among the sleepy Christians of this tremendous hour..

How\npainfully true!

      "Danger":"If you want to have an ecumenical religion, for a One World Order, that pleases everyone, you cannot have one religion claiming that Jesus is the only way. That is not acceptable to Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, and many others. Jesus must be reduced, on par with all the other religious leaders, which means his divinity must be denied, and his claim to be the only way to salvation must be removed. Modern versions are the ecumenical tools to unite all religions. Eugene Nida, considered one of greatest modern linguists and Executive Secretary for Translations for the American Bible Society, recounts the following experience: “After completing a series of lectures at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome, I chatted with a young Jesuit who expressed his appreciation for what I had said about putting the Scriptures into the every-day language of the people. He insisted that this was the most important development since the Reformation.”[505] The goal of Rome has ever been world domination and control of all religions. Ever since the reformation they have bent every effort to reestablish their lost supremacy. If modern bibles are the most important development since the reformation, then they are the most important tool to overthrow everything the reformation has done. Speaking to the Parliament of World Religions, Philipp Schaff said, “There is a unity of Christian scholarship of all creeds… This unity has been strikingly illustrated in the Anglo-American Revision of the Authorized Version of the Scriptures.”[506] Schaff credits the unity of all creeds at the parliament to the American Standard Version and Revised Version of the Bible.\n\nKlein, Martin.

      "Evidence":"In this rendering, everyone is saved, not just the nations of them which are saved. A universalist approach is necessary to unite all religions of the world—a religion universal enough for no religion to object to unification, but exclusive enough to categorize anyone who objects as not being among those upon whom God’s favor rests.\n\nKlein, Martin.

      "Explanation":" These two translations of this verse are certainly not the same. They are different statements. The question\nnaturally arises which is the original? Which is the oldest? Which one has been corrupted? Which is the\ntrue version and which is the perversion? The claim for the N.I.V. and other modern Versions is that they\nare found in such ancient manuscripts as the Siniaticus and Vaticanus and the lesser known Alexandrian\nmanuscripts of the fourth century. This claim instead of supporting the N.I.V. condemns it as we shall see.\nThe evidences on the other hand in favor of the Authorized Version (KJV) go back to much earlier years.\nNote these facts:-\n1. One very interesting and little used line of evidence is found in the writings of the earliest Church\nFathers. When quoting Revelation 22:14 they All quote \"do His commandments.\" These Include Tertullian\n(AD 200) Cyprian (AD 248-258) and. Tertonius (AD 390). The first of the others to quote Revelation 22:14\nas \"wash their robes\" was Athanasius, Bislop of Alexandria, in the fourth century (AD 326-373)\nThis proves positively that the only earliest and true words of this text are \"do His commandments.\" They\nwere the originals. These early men knew nothing of \"wash -their robes.\" The words \"wash their robes\" did\nnot appear. until the fourth century.\nThe fourth century was the century of corruptions on a gigantic scale. It was the century of Constantine,\nJerome and Eusebius. It was the century of the introduction of the pagan symbol, the cross. It was the\ncentury that brought in Sunday in place of the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. It was the century in which the\nchurch adopted so many corruptions of doctrine and practice. It was a bad century, moreover, it brought\nmany corruptions into the Scripture. This was the century that gave birth to the Latin Vulgate by Jerome.\nThis was the manuscript of Scripture that contained \"many errors.\" Great Controversy, page 56.\nThese corrupt words of Revelation 22:14 \"washed their robes\" most likely began in the home of corruption\n- Alexandria. Alexandria was the home of Clement, and Origen, philosophers who greatly corrupted\nChristianity.\nThus the plain facts of church history show that the Christians of the first centuries knew that Revelation\n22:14 said \"do His commandments.\" The words \"washed their robes\" was a corruption that probably\noriginated in Egypt in the time of corruption, namely \"the fourth century.\" It appears all that came out of\nthe fourth century is corruption and perversions. Another interesting line of evidence is found in the:\n2. The Aramaic or Syriac.\nAs I write, before me is the New Testament in the Syriac. All authorities \"frankly admit that Jesus spoke\nAramaic and His teachings were handed down in that language.\" Here is a photocopy of a large section of\nthe Introduction. This is both interesting and to the point.",
