The Reformation restored Biblical truths that had been buried in the ritualism and errors of the Catholic church. Because of the Reformation, the Bible was freely given to the nations in their own languages. These cataclysmic changes sent shock waves through the world. First led by a handful of courageous Reformers within the Catholic church, the movement took on a life of its own as people internalized the Scriptures and put its lessons into practice. Many gave their lives, defending the truths theyâ€™d discovered. Led by the Spirit of God, for a time, the Reformation was unstoppable. All that has changed. Is the Reformation over? Have its lessons become irrelevant to us? What has happened in the last 500 years that caused the Reformation to sputter and die? Learn why a clear understanding of the issues dealt with by the Reformation is of vital importance to our salvation today.
